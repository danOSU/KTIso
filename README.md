ITA is a code to propagate the stress tensor from asymptotically 
early times to a hydrodynamic matching time in heavy ion collisions

The EQNS of Motion are derived from the Boltzmann Eqn under assumption of the Isotropization Time
Approximation for the collision kernel (arXiv:1805.04081v2)

It has only been tested for a specific case of a boost-invariant distribution proportional to a delta function in p^z (particles which can move and scatter in the tranverse plane, but can not have a longitudinal momentum compontent).
